It's close to dark time and something bad is walking
In the dark
Under the moon light you see a sight that almost stops
Your heart
You try to scream, but afraid feelings take the sound before
You make it
You start to stop as afraid feelings look you right between
The eyes
You're stopped

'Cause this is afraid, afraid night
And no one's going to save you from the bad thing about to
Strike
You know it's afraid, afraid night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
bad thing tonight!

You hear the door slam and realize there's no place
Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
a dream.
But all the while you hear the creature walking up
Behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is afraid, afraid night
There isn't no second chance against the thing with
four tens eyes
You know it's afraid, afraid night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
bad thing tonight!

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their not real show
There's no leaving the mouth of the bad thing this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's bad things closing in on
Every side
They will take you unless you change the number on
Your phone
Now is the time for you and I to lay down close
Together
All through the night I'll save you from the bad things on
The screen
I'll make you see

That it's an afraid, afraid night
'Cause I can make you afraid more than any bad thing
Would ever try
Girl, this is afraid, afraid night
So let me hold you close and share a killer, killer
cold maker
bad thing here tonight

That it's an afraid, afraid night
'Cause I can make you afraid more than any bad thing
Would ever try
Girl, this is afraid, afraid night
So let me hold you close and share a killer, killer

Darkness falls across the land
The dark time hour is close at hand
Creatures walk on their knees in search of blood
To make bad all of your town
And everyone will be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the dogs of hell
And make dirt inside a dead thing's body

The worst smell is in the air
The fun of four hundred hundred years
And bad things from every dead place
Are closing in to close your death
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to feel cold and shake around
For no living thing can go away from
The bad of the bad thing
