<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p>
I am a <strong>12</strong> year old boy living in Brooklyn, NY. My father's brother is letting me have an account on the site, <a href="http://www.lk.net">lk.net</a>. You can learn about him <a href="http://borisv.lk.net">here</a><br>
I have a <a href="chromebook.google.com">chromebook</a> which I got when I was 10, a <a href="raspberrypi.org">Raspberry pi</a>, and a <a href="makeymakey.org">Makey-Makey</a> for fun projects.<br>
I like programming, especially web programming and stuff. I am best at HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I also know a little ruby.<br>
I also really like skiing and I think I am really good at it. I have visited Mt.Tremblant, and Elk mountain, but I mostly ski on a small mountain called Ski Big Bear, in pennsylvania.<br>
I really like just surfing the internet and making stuff.<br>
I go to school at <a href="http://brooklynschoolofinquiry.org/">Brooklyn School Of Inquiry(BSI, PS/IS 686)</a> and am in the 6th grade. This is me:<br>
